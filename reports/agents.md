# Agent desk (paper trading)

Updated 2026-10-22 09:52 UTC. Runs so far: 13. Model: claude-haiku-5-5.

Money is paper, $10,000 per desk. Memecoin costs 2.5% (normal) and 5% (pessimistic) per side. Team desk: experimental, no strategy rules, sizes up to 10% (gold/forex with 10x leverage). Control desk: frozen v3 memecoin rules ($200 per trade) and random gold/forex trades risking $100.

## Team

API spend today: $0.11 (cap $3, aiming for about $1.50)
- Lead (team lead and analyst, mission all): Decide what the team trades. Weigh every idea against costs and the journal. Look for repeatable edges, not one-off bets.
- Scout (researcher, mission macro): Bring ideas from prices, news, the economic calendar and politics. State each idea as a testable hypothesis.
- Sniper (execution, mission macro): Turn approved ideas into exact orders: size, optional stop and target, holding time, and early exits.
