# Agent desk (paper trading)

Updated 2026-10-21 14:41 UTC. Runs so far: 9. Model: claude-haiku-5-5.

Money is paper, $10,000 per desk. Memecoin costs 2.5% (normal) and 5% (pessimistic) per side. Team desk: experimental, no strategy rules, sizes up to 10% (gold/forex with 10x leverage). Control desk: frozen v3 memecoin rules ($200 per trade) and random gold/forex trades risking $100.

| team | meme | 4 | 75 | -22.7 | -32.38 |
| team | macro | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| team | all | 4 | 75 | -22.7 | -32.38 |
| control | meme | 50 | 20 | -2034.84 | -2495.46 |
| control | macro | 1 | 0 | -104.66 | -108.95 |
| control | all | 51 | 20 | -2139.5 | -2604.41 |

Verdict: too early, 4 of 50 team trades needed before judging.

## Team

API spend today: $0.07 (cap $3, aiming for about $1.50)
- Lead (team lead and analyst, mission all): Decide what the team trades. Weigh every idea against costs and the journal. Look for repeatable edges, not one-off bets.
- Scout (researcher, mission all): Bring ideas from prices, news, the economic calendar and politics. State each idea as a testable hypothesis.
- Sniper (execution, mission all): Turn approved ideas into exact orders: size, optional stop and target, holding time, and early exits.

## Last run

- control: CLOSED HUMANOID (stop) P&L $-63.31 normal, $-71.94 pessimistic
